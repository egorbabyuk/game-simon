### **How To Play**
_______

In the main menu, you can choose the difficulty level (Easy by default), which affects the initial number of tiles to memorize and the speed of the animations.

The game begins after pressing the start button and the corresponding timer in the center. The player needs to remember the combination of highlighted tiles and repeat it. One correct tile is worth one point.
With each completed stage, the number of tiles increases by one and the speed of the animations increases.

After losing, the player sees the overall result and can restart the game or exit to the menu.


*Easy level - start with 2 tiles, low speed.*

*Medium level - start with 3 tiles, average speed*

*Hard level* - start with 5 tiles, high speed.*
